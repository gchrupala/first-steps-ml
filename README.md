# First steps in Machine Learning

These lecture slides are from an introductory course on machine
learning which I teach at Tilburg University.  It does not presuppose
any background in math or computer science, but the practical parts do
assume basic knowledge of Python.

## Lectures

- Introduction. What is machine learning.
- Representations. K-Nearest-neighbors.
- Decision Trees.
- Perceptron.
- Gradient descent.
- Logistic regression.
- Clustering and unsupervised learning (guest lecture by Afra Alishahi).
- Neural networks.
